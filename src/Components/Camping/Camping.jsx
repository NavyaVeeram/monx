Camping is not any normal activity, and you must be astonished right now but it is true as there are many forms of camping and the list is quite big as we must say.

<h5>So here are the most common and widely known forms of camping :-</h5>

 

The Tent Camping :- This is the most basic and widely known form of camping as here people they establish a tent on the ground, Most likely in a forest or on the bank of a river or lake at a good ground. Here you pitch a tent and stay over night, This method requires quite a bit number of resources and good tent pitching skills, But at Wild valley everything is covered and readily served to you.

The RV camping :- This is the second form of camping that is a Van camping method, here the people can go on a road trip to the nature and have all the vibe of the camping experience at the desired location but the only thing is that they stay at their own RV rather than pitching a tent. Aside from that both of these forms are more or less the same.​

Backpacking :- This is a little different type of camping form, Where people carry their essentials in a backpack and either trek or move thru the nature for quite some time and at nights they stay in Sleeping bags or they pitch a tent as well. But this form goes on for quite some time, The only drawback of this is that you have to carry everything on your back but the perk is that you can relocate and have amazing experience of various places and enjoy all of them at once rather than staying stationary at one.

Car Camping :- At last we have a very traditional form of camping, though might not be allowed in some places, but it is quite common in western countries and it is known as car camping where people can simply establish their bonfires and have a good time in the nature and camp at night in their own car and sleep there.
